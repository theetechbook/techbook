## Overview
### Description
[<img src=".gif" width = "600">]()


TechBook is a free social networking platform that enables its users( tech professionals) to upload and share their GIFs and photos with other users.  Techbook users can choose to share information either publicly or privately. Anything shared publicly can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared content can only be accessed by the specified set of people.

We designed a simpler version where a user can share photos and follow other users. The â€˜News Feedâ€™ for each user will consist of top photos or gifs of all the people the user follows.
 
The app displays a list of conference events and allows the user to filter these events by 
types and by topics (Android, Firebase, etc.). Users can see details about
events, and they can star events that interest them. Conference attendees can
reserve events to guarantee a seat.

# Development Environment

### Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Technology 

- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for easy posting. Users will use their phone's built-in camera to take photos and upload them to their feed. 

- **Features:**  The app displays a list of conference events near the user.  Users can see details about events, such as name, date, time, and location.  In addition, they can star events that interest them.  Future features will include allowing users to filter these events by event types and by topics(Android, Bitcoin, etc).   
 
- **Story:** Allows users to answer questions such as, "What events are near me? How can I promote myself? Or Where can I find tech talent"? Users will be able to create a profile and upload their content to either share publicly or privately.  Users will be able to search local technology theme events and save them to their accounts for easy access and use. They'll also be able to "likes" posts and receive messages on their own posts, for positive validations 


- **Scope** Our application will allow users to post on the live feed.  This will allow users to upload photos or gifs of their projects and content.  We believe that the best version of the app will provide a rich user experience to engage and interact with other users.
